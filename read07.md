# Comparison Operators: Evaluating Conditions 
There are a few comparison operators, what they do is that they compare an item to the left of the operator to an item to the right of the operator, and then return (usually) a `true` or `false` result, for example:
- `==`
Which means `is equal to` while also ignoring the datatype, it only looks at the content, meaning what you see is what you compare.
- `!=`
Which means `is NOT equal to`, this also ignores datatypes and only compares the content.
- `===`
This is a `strict equal to`, the difference between this and `==` is that this one also compares datatype in addition to content, making it more `strict`.
- `!==`
Same as `===`, just that it's `strict NOT equal to`.
- `>`
As in normal math, it means `Greater than`, this only compares numbers.
- `<`
The same as `>`, just it means `less than`
- `>=`
This is the same as `>`, just that it has an extra option for being equal, meaning it checks if the number of the left is bigger or _equal_ to the one of the left.
- `<=`
same as `>=`, just the opposite direction if comparsion.
## Logical Operators
Comparison operators usually give you either `true` or `false`, and Logical Operators allow you to compare that result with another one.
For example:
- `&&`
Which is called a `logical and`, it more or less just means _and_, which is used to know if both items on the left and right are `true` and then return `true`, otherwise the result will be `false`.
- `||`
Which is called a `logical or`, this one just checks of either of the items on the left or right are `true`, and then returns a `true` result.
- !
This one doesn't compare two items, it only takes one item, and then flips it.
# Loops
A loop, as the name suggests, is a code block that keeps on re-running and looping until a certain condition is fulfilled.
Common types of loops include:
- `for`
This runs the loop for a set amount of times, and is the most common type of loop, the condition is a number counter.
- `while`
This is used when you don't know how many times the loop should run, the condition here can be different things than just a counter.
- `do while`
This loop is similar to the `while` loop, but there's one key difference, this loop will always run _at least_ once, contrary to the `while` loop which can sometimes (depending on the code) not run at all.
