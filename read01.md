# Markdown
## what is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight programming language, it's usually used because it's fast, and works in many sites, although it's mostly used on `GitHub.com`.
The language is easy to use, you can easily **bold** or *italic* text, make ordered lists:
1. item 1
2. item 2
and unordered lists:
- item 3
- item 4
  - item 4.a
  - item 4.b

Make different size headers
# header 1
### header 2
###### header
Or maybe even
> quote someone
and much more, it's pretty easy to get the hang of, but can be pretty useful to learn. :grin:

# GitHub Pages
## What is GitHub Pages?
It is a pretty useful feature on GitHub for developers, as it allows them to publish their projects on a website without having to deal with servers and hosting and whatnot, allowing you to share your code without too much trouble.
You can choose from a few default HTML themes on GitHub, but for the best results you'd have to make your own.
