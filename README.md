# Growth mindset
What is a _growth mindset_? it's a great mindset to have, a positive and creative one.
The main point about growth mindset is that: 
-talent
-intelligence 
Are secondary to effort. 
In other words, *just keep trying and you'll reach your goal*, god willing, no matter how hard it the subject seems to be at the start, effort brings result.

>Don't decrease the goal. increase the effort

### On the other hand,
We have what we call a `fixed mindset`, which is the total opposite, this mindset encourages stagnation, avoidance of effort and that your pain doesn't matter. In a way it's a somewhat of a nihilistic worldview.
It has a few a points that just don't work well:
1. belittling of effort
2. giving up because "I'm just not made for this"

<br/><br/>

# So,
It's important to try a few things:
1. [x] give your self challanges
2. [x] learn to accept being challanged
3. [x] go over the obstacles
4. [x] you'll fail, it's natural
5. [x] again, keep putting the effort
6. [x] accept criticism, as that's how fix what we didn't know needed fixing
7. [x] rememeber to not compare yourself to others

<br/><br/> 
#### A quick comparison:
Growth mindset | fixed mindset
------------ | -------------
keep putting effort | give up after trying once
failing is part of the proccess | failing is the end of the proccess

~~Give up~~ Just keep trying :grin:
