# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

## Reading

* What is functional programming?

a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

&nbsp;


* What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

It returns the same result if given the same arguments, and It does not cause any observable side effects.

&nbsp;


* What are the benefits of a pure function?

You'll always get the same result, as all the code a pure function uses is inside of it or gets past to it as parameters.

&nbsp;


* What is immutability?

When talking about data, it means the state of the data cannot be changed after it’s created.

&nbsp;


* What is Referential transparency?

if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

&nbsp;

* What is a module?

Modules are small-ish certain packages of code and js files that we can use to do specific things, we use them so we don't have to download a metric ton of code everytime, and instead just get this comparatively small number of files. 

&nbsp;


* What does the word ‘require’ do?

require imports and gets the module from the specified path, so you can not use the module in any file you want.

&nbsp;


* How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

by assigning a variable to whatever `require` gets from the the modules.

&nbsp;


* What do we have to do to make a module available?

you first have to export it, using `module.export = function;`
