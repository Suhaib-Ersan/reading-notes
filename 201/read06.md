## JS Object Literals

### What is an object in JS?

> Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. - Jon Duckett

And in objects, variables become properties, and functions becomes methods. And the names of those variables or functions become known as a key.

There a few ways of creating objects, the easiest and most popular one is called a "Literal Notation".
You first declare a variable, then inside the variable you put curly braces `{}`, inside those curly braces is the object.
