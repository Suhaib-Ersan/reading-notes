# HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

## Lists

>There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:
>
>* Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
>* Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
>* Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
- Jon Duckett

### Ordered Lists

You first have to write an `<ol>` element.
And then for each list item you'd have to create `<li>` element.
Example:

```
<ol>
    <li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>
    <li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20
        minutes until tender</li>
    <li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>
    <li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>
    <li>Mix in the milk mixture</li>
</ol>
```

and this would appear like this:

<ol>
    <li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>
    <li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20
        minutes until tender</li>
    <li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>
    <li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>
    <li>Mix in the milk mixture</li>
</ol>
