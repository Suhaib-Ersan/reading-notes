# AWS: S3 and Lambda

* Describe “The Cloud”

The "cloud" is just a bunch of servers, it's nothing more than a bunch of servers with predefined tasks and things they can do.

&nbsp;

* What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

It is a way to package your application, so that it doesn't break when you transfer it from a server to another, it also allows servers to run more applications (since it can now run "containers" instead of just applications).

&nbsp;

* What is auto-scaling?

It is when the service provider gives your application enough resources to do what it wants do automatically.

&nbsp;

* What is bandwidth?

It's the amount of data allowed in a single second between two components.

&nbsp;

* How do cloud providers compute service costs?

Differs depending on who's the provider, could be fixed monthly or daily or hourly, could be depending on application up-time in hours, or even in seconds and micro-seconds depending on the service used.
