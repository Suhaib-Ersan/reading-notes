* How do bearer tokens work?

They work by using a token (usually JWT) to allow the user to send this data quickly and securely to the server, and then the server decodes the token to check if the user is actually who they say they are.

* Describe express middleware

It's a block of code that runs for the certain paths or certain methods as desired, and it changes the code in some way in doing so.

&nbsp;

* What is a JWT?

A JsonWebToken, they work by encoding user data and other info to a token, and then also encrypting a "secret" to the end of it, this secret allows us (if we have the secret) to check if the data was changed in any way.
