# Trees 

* Teach something that you learned. Then review what one of your classmates learned.

Trees are data structures that have their limitations, but also their pros, like being fast in certain data gathering tasks.    
They are defined as a data structure that uses Nodes that reference their "children" nodes, and this starts from a single point called the "root", which is a node that is saved in the tree class/somewhere we can reference.  
Trees sometimes have a set number of children, most notably the "binary" tree which only has two children max, which are called a "left" and a "right" in any node, a binary tree needs to have a certain structure, usually the right node is bigger than the current node, and the left is smaller.
