# Context API - Behaviors

* When you have multiple contexts, what component type should you use (class/function) and why?

Functions, because of it's simpler syntax and as such better results.

&nbsp;

* What are some good use cases for using the Context API for global state?

If you have some data that you want to pass from your main js file to a far away child in the chain, or data that many files need to use.

&nbsp;

* How can you best test context?

By using the app as any user would use it, and not by testing it directly.
