# Component Based UI

* Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)

Angular, Vue.js, Polymer, Aurelia, svelte.

&nbsp;

* Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?

A library doesn't change your entire work-flow and syntax, and you will usually just use it for a specific task and not the entire application.   
Frameworks on the other hand will usually change your entire work-flow and a lot of your syntax, and will usually require quite a bit of time before you get used to using them.   
Frameworks are usually much bigger projects also.
