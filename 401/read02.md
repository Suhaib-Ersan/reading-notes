* Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

I don't think I understand what this question wants from me.
But, 404 is used in APIs when the server can't find anything, and 500 is used when the server encounters an internal error for example.

SOAP, which is `Simple Object Access Protocol`, which is a protocol for how to handle api requests, and uses service interfaces.
REST, which stands for `Representational State Transfer`, is and architectural pattern, and is used to handle APIs on the web, uses Uniform Service locators.
