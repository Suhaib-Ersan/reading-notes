# Event Driven Applications

Why is access control important?

Because there's a lot of data we don't want just anyone to see.


&nbsp;

* Describe an application that would need access control.

Any website that has the ability to sign up or sign in, Any social media app, any bank app...etc


&nbsp;

* What is a role used for?

To verify what are the permission of the signed in user.


&nbsp;

* Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

Discretionary access control is more or less impossible on a large scale, as it depends on a person allowing allowing/not allowing each person access to a section.    
Mandatory access control is very secure, but as it is mainly designed and is usually used in governmental institutes, it wasn't designed for company/real world access, it quite slow in comparison to role based access control, and it requires high amount of resources to maintain.
