* Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)

A singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance.


&nbsp;

* Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes

Not sure, maybe by using consts? or maybe by creating an object from a class and then just using that?

* If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?

That's a hard question that I don't think I'm at a level that can answer it, but maybe make the `get` and `post` and other http methods in express be function that can take as many callbacks(middleware) as you want? and then run that each time this method gets called?
