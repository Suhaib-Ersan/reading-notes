# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

* What are serverless functions?

They are functions that are deployed to service providers, the service provider takes care of the rest, and no need to assign a server to these functions as the providers will just give them the resources they need.

&nbsp;

* If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?

By first making a system that allows each function to take as many resources as it needs, even if it's cross-server, and then making sure that we have backups for everything, then partner with other service providers so developers can use any service that they want.

* Describe how a CDN works

It's a database of uploaded libraries and the like, and anyone can request a library to download.
